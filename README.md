# RNN-language-modeling
A 2 layered Recursive neural network for language modeling using THEANO

This code is a modified verison of the code written by Denny Britz at  http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/

The above code supports one layer RNN and I made an attempt using Theano to add one more layer to the RNN
